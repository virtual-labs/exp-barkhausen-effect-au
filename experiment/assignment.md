    <ol type="A">
      <li>Growth of the domains parallel to the applied field at the expense of other domains and then the reorientation of the domains themselves.</li>
      <li>The orientation of the domains and then growth of the domains parallel to the applied field.</li>
      <li>The orientation of each domain in the applied field.</li>
      <li>None of these.</li>
    </ol>



2. In the simulation, what happens to intensity of emf,
    <ol type="A">
      <li>When the number of turns increases?</li>
      <li>When the south pole of the magnet is brought closer to the rod?</li>
      <li>When the bar is removed?</li>
    </ol>
 

3. Discuss whether Barkhausen Effect will affect the speaker when a bar magnet is placed nearby it.

4. What are the factors that depend on the intensity of sound produced by Barkhausen effect?

5. Study how Barkhausen Effect affects the electric circuit.
