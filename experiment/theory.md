### Theory 

A ferromagnet has a spontaneous magnetic moment. The atoms (or molecules) of ferromagnetic materials have a net intrinsic magnetic dipole moment which is primarily due to the spin of electrons. The interaction, called as spin exchange interaction, between the neighbouring atomic magnetic dipoles is very strong and exists even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
 
Magnetization could be explained based on Domain theory. Weiss postulated the existence of domains within the ferromagnetic material. Within these domains the material is magnetized to saturation but the direction of magnetization differs from domain to domain, resulting in a zero resultant magnetization of the specimen. The process of magnetization consists in rotating the different domains in the direction of applied external field so that the specimen exhibits a net magnetization externally.
