## Procedure

### Apparatus
Circular coil, ferromagnetic material, bar magnet, speaker, amplifier, connecting wire, etc..

### Variable Region
#### Slider
- Using this slider, the number of turns of the coil can be varying. 
#### Measurement Region
- The show rod check box will enable and disable the rod inside the coil.
- The show Graph check box enables the amplified output graph.  
 
### Performing the simulation:

The user has the privilege to move the magnet round the stage according to the magnetic movement the rod gets magnetize and the sound produced can be heard. 

- Move the magnet around the stage. Change of magnetic flux produce fluctuating current. That can be heard as noise from the speaker.
- Repeat the experiment with different situations like increase the number of coil, remove the rod,etc. And observe the result
